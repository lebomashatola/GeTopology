# GeTopology - Bimodal Phenotype Prediction

## Description

GeTopology processes RNA-Seq files (.fastq), microarray files (.CEL) and tissue slide images (.SVS), performs shape encoding on gene expression data suing TDA, and performs a predictive learning task using a bimodal approach using convolutional and multilayer perceptron neural networks to predict phenotype.
